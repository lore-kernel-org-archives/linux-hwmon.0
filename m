The driver sets pwm values. The pwm-fan driver sets pwm values. A pwm driver
sets pwm values. The pwm-fan driver uses a pwm driver to set pwm values.
You appear to be arguing that the pwm-fan driver for Rpi is different than
a pwm-fan driver for all other hardware and should _not_ use a pwm driver
to set pwm values.

As you don't understand my question, I don't understand your rationale either.
I will require detailed explanations why 2) is not feasible, and why 1) is not
feasible either. Until then, NACK.
