The binding should only explain how we describe the hardware in an
operating-system
independent way, but not talk about how an OS is supposed to implement those
drivers.

Having multiple drivers each provide an exported function is not possible
in Linux: it immediately breaks building an 'allyesconfig' kernel, and prevents
you from running the same kernel across multiple implementations, so that
has to be redesigned anyway.

Is this only an initial list that you expect to be extended in the
future, or is this
a complete list of sensors that can ever be connected to PECI?

Should this be PECI version specific?
