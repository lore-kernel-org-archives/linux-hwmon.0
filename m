Agreed, I'll consider redesigning of it.

Oops! I made this many typos in this single line. Thanks for your 
pointing it out. Will fix these.

The maximum supportable number of dimm slots is not PECI version 
specific but depends on CPU architecture. Currently IA supports up to 16 
slot as the maximum but it could vary in the future architecture.
