Then please try to move the common code into a single function.

Seems to me the necessary information to identify a given CPU should
be provided by the PECI core. Also, there are already "cpu" nodes
in devicetree which, if I recall correctly, may include information
such as CPU Ids.

And there is no other means to get the number of DIMM slots per CPU ?
It just seems to be that this is the wrong location to provide such
information.

I don't really know enough about the system to make a recommendation.
It seems to me that the PECI core should identify which functionality
it supports and instantiate the necessary driver(s). Maybe there should
be sub-nodes to the peci node with relevant information. Those sub-nodes
should specify the supported functionality in more detail, though -
such as indicating the supported CPU and/or DIMM sensors.
