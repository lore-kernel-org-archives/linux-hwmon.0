I've been pretty happy with the progress in merging drivers upstream
for OpenBMC. Of course things always take longer than planned,
but they are getting there. Most servers today are probably running
the aspeed vendor kernel based on linux-2.6.28.10, at least that's
what my workstation runs (and no, I did not connect the BMC to my
home network).

The particular choices of mainline versions (4.10 and 4.13) may be
unfortunate as they are both one off from a longterm release, but
not being stuck on 2.6 is the important first step in order to upstream
stuff.

Why would anyone want to have multiple kernel trees just to run
things on different SoCs? ;-)

It's just a collection of device drivers in different stages of getting
upstreamed.

I'm ususally happy with having git with topic branches to make the
rebasing easier. In many cases, you can just leave a topic branch
for a particular subsystem unchanged between versions and just
merge the latest version of those branches until the branch goes
away after upstreaming.
