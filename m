No, because the property only states that the timeout should be disabled.
It does not say that it should be _enabled_ if the property is not there.
That would require a different property. A -> B does not imply B -> A.

We would have to lock the alarm bits again, leaving them in a consistent
state.

Let's just leave it as-is. If we encounter a problem later we can always
add code to unlock/lock the alarm bits.
