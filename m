The standard does specify the units, but the way it is written seems to
suggest that the units are part of the platform implementation rather
than part of the standard [0].

In addition to the thermal sub-subsystem, hwmon sysfs interface also
expects temperature in millidegree Celsius. Ideally, any change should
fix the reporting there as well. More below.

Another way to fix this would be to add optional properties to the scpi
sensors binding and use them instead. This could then be used to fixup
values reported to both thermal and hwmon.
