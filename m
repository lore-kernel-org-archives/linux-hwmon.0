I investigated it more deeply. Basically, by the spec, PECI bus speed
cannot be set as a fixed speed. A PECI bus can have a wide speed range
from 2Kbps to 2Mbps which is dynamically set by a handshaking sequence
between an originator and clients called 'timing negotiation' in spec.
This timing negotiation behavior happens on every single transaction so 
the bus speed also can vary on every transactions. So I'm thinking a 
custom property name for it, 'peci-clk-frequency' if it is acceptable.

Thanks,

Jae
