Yes, exactly.  Of course, not all of them use "show_" at the beginning.
get_ and set_ are used as well. Essentially I would want to replace 
	[driver_prefix]{show_,get_,set_}func{_get,_show,_set}
with 'func'.

If you have an idea how to do that, any hints would be welcome.

It should be obvious that using the {RO,RW,WO} variants is less error prone.
Can anyone seriously argue against that ?

If the problem is that people need to see exact permission numbers instead
of "RO" to understand that an attribute is read only, I think the semantic
patch should really be added to the kernel.
