I would suggest .../bindings/hwmon/jc42.txt. Even though the functionality is
supported by various SMBus chips, it is not supported by _every_ SMBus chip.

I also found this:

https://github.com/opennetworklinux/linux/blob/master/3.2.65-1%2Bdeb7u2/patches/driver-adt7470-knob-to-disable-smbus-timeout.patch

which suggests that we should find a common solution (even though that patch
never found its way upstream).

Rob, are you ok with "smbus-timeout-disable" as suggested above ?

Thanks,
Guenter
