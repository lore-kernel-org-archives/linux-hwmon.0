This is a driver that talks to an embedded CPU running firmware which is
capable of giving various informations about the DRAM chip being
populated, including a temperature trend (hotter or cooler). We thought
initially we would be able to expose the actual temperature, but this in
turn required a lot more knowledge about the DRAM chip that we wish we
knew about. That is sort of where and why this driver was proposed for
hwmon.

Which subsystem do you think would be best for this driver drivers/misc/
or drivers/soc/bcm/brcmstb/ maybe?
