Wow, that is pretty well hidden. Table 3.87 doesn't specify units.
I agree, this appears to imply that the units are intentionally
platform specific. Unfortunately it doesn't specify the data format,
not even for the development platform, so I guess we'll have to
brace ourselves for inventive new data formats.

Yes, this would be much more appropriate.
