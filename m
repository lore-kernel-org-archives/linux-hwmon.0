It contains support for our hardware that I have integrated from work
in progress patches and upstream commits.

The OpenBMC project, with myself as the kernel maintainer, have
intentions to regularly move to upstream releases. This takes time and
effort. This time and effort is balanced with submitting our drivers
upstream.

Linus' tree does not contain all of the drivers required to boot
systems. Many of them are still under review on lkml, and others still
require rewrite from the vendor tree.

We have PECI, video compression, crypto, USB CDC, DRM (graphics),
serial GPIO, LPC mailbox for the ASPEED SoC.

Another silicon vendor has recently joined the project and that brings
an entire SoC that is not upstream. We have patches on the ARM that
are under review for this SoC, with more drivers undergoing cleanup in
order to submit them to the relevant maintainers.

We have a process that we've been developing under for the past few
years. I find git to be a great tool for managing Linux kernel trees.

What would you recommend for managing kernel trees?

Cheers,
