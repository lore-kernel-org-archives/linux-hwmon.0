TL;DR Either way is fine.

I think it's a bugfix; it fixes real problems where the application
misbehave due to faulty content when reading from an eeprom. I'm
expecting to make a new release for the hw in question RSN and these
are the only local patches. So, it would be nice if they made it to
4.14.x before my release happens. However, it's not like it's difficult
to rebase the patches should that backport not happen or take too long.

The badness started to happen much more frequently due to some timing
difference affecting the i2c bus driver, but in theory it's a problem
that has been there from the start. I have just not noticed it before...

Cheers,
Peter
