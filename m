That's a benefit, but it's makes it difficult to review.
I also have the same patch rewrap alignment post this
automated patch, done with emacs formatting.

This patch is somewhat simpler to review which is why
it's not sent along with this script.

Another approach would be to separate the const bits
from the non-const bits to reduce data.

Maybe true.

Not sure backports are a real issue.

If it were a real issue, the updated permissions are noise
and shouldn't be accepted for the other changes.
