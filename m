__init_memblock ...

... as is memblock_is_map_memory(), which we call from pfn_valid() which is
EXPORT_SYMBOL()'d
and used from modules, (e.g. mac80211.ko). So something fishy is going on...

arm64 doesn't define ARCH_DISCARD_MEMBLOCK, so we always keep these symbols.
If we didn't, pfn_valid() would break too.
