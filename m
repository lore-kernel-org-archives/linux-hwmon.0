Hi Pavel,

Please see my answer inline.

This driver is not for local CPUs which this driver is running on. 
Instead, this driver will be running on BMC (Baseboard Management 
Controller) kernel which is separated from the server machine. In this 
implementation, it provides just read-only access for monitoring the 
server's CPU and DIMM temperatures remotely through a PECI connection. 
The BMC can control fans according to the monitoring data if the BMC has 
a fan control interface and feature, but it depends on baseboard 
hardware and software designs.
