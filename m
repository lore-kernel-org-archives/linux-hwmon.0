I think the large majority can, and should, be switched to use the
RO,RW,WO variants.  Developers should never be having to specify sysfs
file permissions if at all possible, as they get them wrong too many
times, as we have found out in the past...

Those are fine, why do people object to them?

Yes, reusing the function names is not possible, but note, that is a
usually a rare case, the "normal" case for a sysfs attribute can use
these macros just fine.
