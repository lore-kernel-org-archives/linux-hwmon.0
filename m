I have sent the patches.  I adjusted the semantic patch so that the
indentation of function parameters/arguments would only change if the
length of the function name changes.

Do you think this could be of more general interest in the Linux kernel?
Since the semantic patch works pretty well, I could add it to the
scripts/coccinelle directory?  Previously, however, I got some negative
feedback about this change, because people felt that the new names hid the
actual behavior, so I didn't pursue it.
