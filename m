I think that's inaccurate.

The h/w and the firmware combined is the "platform" from Linux POV.
Channels are physical resources provided by a mailbox controller.
Currently the firmware listens on Channel-7 but some future revision
might switch to, say, Channel-9.  Or say the same firmware on next
revision of h/w may have to switch to Channel-3 because it has only 4
channels. So I see the mailbox channel number as a hardware property
just like an IRQ (which very often change with SoC iterations).

Cheers.
