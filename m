SMBus timeout is a standard SMBus functionality, so I would say any. It is by
default enabled on an SMBus device (actually it is not just enabled, it is
mandatory). The ability to disable it comes handy if a SMBus chip is connected
to an I2C controller which does not (or not necessarily) follow SMBus rules.

I had seen that problem myself with MAX6697, and STTS751 (and its driver) also
supports it.

I don't want to change behavior if the property is not present. After all,
the timeout may have been disabled by the BIOS/ROMMON (especially in systems
w/o DT support). So far having the boolean flag was never a problem; as
mentioned above, the timeout is by default (and per spec) enabled on SMBus
devices. I would argue that anyone who disabled it must have done so on
purpose (including "trying out things"), and that it should not be DT
responsibility to have a flag along the line of "restore default
configuration".
