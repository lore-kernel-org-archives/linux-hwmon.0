So a return value of -19 eigher means that the offset/slope is -19 or that the
thermal subsystem is disabled. What does a return value of -17 mean ? How does
one distinguish the two ? Either the functions return negative error codes or
they don't. Or at least I think that is how it should be.

How do you know in which order to apply slope and offset ? In other words,
how do you know that the offset is scaled and not the raw offset ?

The driver author is left wondering how to use those values. The thermal
API specifies that temperatures shall be reported as absolute values in
milli-degrees C. It doesn't specify if and how the driver should or may
use slope and offset as provided by the thermal subsystem to correct its
readings. It doesn't specify what to do if the driver has other means
to correct slope and/or offset internally (such as the lm90 driver,
or the ntc_thermistor driver), or what to do if the provided values don't
fit what hardware provides. It thus adds a lot of ambiguity which will
need to be clarified before the API can be used.

If temperature units are not well defined in SCPI, I have to assume
that other units are not well defined either. You only provide a thermal
subsystem specific solution for the problem, and you don't solve the problem
for the driver itself. On top of that, the solution is incomplete -
it assumes that the raw units may have to be scaled upward, never downward,
and it assumes that the scaling factor is an integer multiple of the raw
value. Given all that, I'd prefer a more comprehensive solution which
also works for the next hardware which decides to report temperatures
in mico-degrees C (or maybe in multiples of 2.5 mC), and voltages/currents
with some arbitrary resolution.

Browsing through the SCPI specification, it looks like you are right;
sensors are defined to return a 64-bit value, but it isn't even specified
if the returned value is signed or unsigned (or floating point, for that
matter), much less its units. I hope I am wrong, but if that is the case,
we'll need a much more comprehensive solution, one that is tied to
'arm,scpi-sensors' and not to the thermal subsystem.
