acpi_os_ioremap() is re-defined in arm64/include/asm/acpi.h.

The problem is that, as memblock_is_memory() is declared as __init,
we cannot build any drivers which call acpi_os_ioremap() as modules.

As far as this specific issue is concerned, if we make a change like:

The build error will be gone. (and still kdump should work.)

But I don't know how we should distinguish IORESOURCE_MEM and
IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM.
