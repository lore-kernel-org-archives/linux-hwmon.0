I do think it would add a lot of value, if for nothing else as an excellent example
of what can be done with coccinelle.

I actually liked the name changes. I think it is a good idea if the function name
reflects the sysfs attribute it serves (isn't that exactly what it does, ie its
behavior ?). But, as you have experienced, some people inadvertently did not like
it. Given that, I am not sure if it is worth adding it to the kernel source tree.
Maybe you could submit it as RFC so it is at least on record.

Anyway, for SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR(), I'll have to be a bit more flexible since
the function _will_ be reused. I'll need something like
	SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_{RO,RW,WO}(attr, func, param)

Maybe Greg would be open to something like DEVICE_ATTR_FUNC_{RO,RW,WO}(attr,func)
to accommodate the "I want my own function name" crowd ? That would also solve
the case where the function is reused for multiple attributes.

Thanks,
Guenter
