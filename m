Ah, I didn't notice that. I guess both patches were correct individually and
got added to linux-next around the same time but caused allmodconfig to blow up
when used together.

Adding everyone who was involved in the memblock patch to Cc here, maybe one
of them has an idea what the correct fix is. There are only two other drivers
using acpi_os_ioremap() and one of them is x86-specific, so it's still likely
that drivers are not actually supposed to use this symbol. Making
acpi_os_ioremap() an exported function in arm64 would also work.
